# Project Goal
- Predict coral spawning time (Linear Regression)

# Project Description
*Have you ever wondered how corals reproduce?*
They reproduce 2 ways:
1. Asexual reproduction, splitting and dividing. 
2. Sexual reproduction, mating between eggs and sperm

The asexual method can happen any time of the year, fast, and massive. That's why it is widely used for many coral restoration projects. 

But the problem remains because it is not sustainable.
Think about the whole community with the same clone. Without genetic diversity, they will be no survivors when there is a widespread disease or a natural catastrophic event e.g. sea temperature rising. If no one carries disease-resistant genes, the whole community will vanish.

Increasing genetic diversity is essential for every species on earth including corals. Therefore, sexual reproduction is the answer. As the eggs and sperm fertilize to create a new generation, there will be a chance of good gene combinations. The gene exchange and mutation allow revolution. This will help coral to adapt to any changes that could happen in the future and/or the change that is happening now.

# Question & Hypothesis
Coral is an animal but it cannot move around. *How does it find a mate and have sexual intercourse?*

And that's why the topic. **Coral spawning!**
Corals release eggs and sperm into the open water in a massive amount. So that there will be more chances for the eggs and sperm to meet and fertilize.

But that means, the male and female of the same specie have to release gametes at the same time or must be very close.


*How do they know when to release?* And *how do they communicate?* 
These questions are still needed answers. We need more research on corals and coral reproductions to fully understand them.
